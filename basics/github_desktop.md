# GitHub Desktop

A simple, yet powerful UI based tool for both git and GitHub that may be useful for all or part of your workflow.

If you already have a git tool you like, or prefer command line tools, this may not be ideal for you. However,
it is a great starting point if you are looking for a tool to allow you to easily get started with our GitHub Flow
workflow.

The [online documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) is more likely to remain up to date than anything we create here, so we'll just cover the
basics of the sections likely to be most of use here.

## Cloning

The process of making a copy of a repository from GitHub (or any git source, but we'll focus on GitHub for the
remainder of this document) to your local computer is called cloning.

Cloning a repository is the first step in making local changes to files in a repository.

[How to clone in GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop).

## Syncing your local repo

Before you make a branch, you'll always want to synchronize changes from GitHub as your local copies will not automatically stay synchronized.

## Creating a branch

[Branching](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch) is a core concept in git.
Before you start making changes, you'll want to create a branch.

You'll make any changes you'd like to introduce to the repository in a branch. This may include
adding, deleting, and editing files.

## Making changes

Once you have selected a branch in GitHub Desktop, you use whatever editor you want to make the changes.

If you don't yet have a preference for text editor, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great option. This is different than the full Visual Studio.

Note: tools like Office or Notes are not good choices as they make undesirable changes to the text and will cause you and others pain and suffering. Use a text editor, not a word processor.

Edit and save files like you would normally do (in a text editor for code/text files).

## Commits

Commits are a way to group a set of proposed changes. Contrary to the name, you are not _yet_ committing to the changes so don't worry if it's perfect!
