# Accessibility / a11y

## Background info

[The A11y Project](https://a11yproject.com/about)

## Goals

- The site is usable by everyone.
- Intentional access restrictions like MIT only are okay.
- Anyone that is authorized to use a site can actually use it.

## Local Coding Projects

- Local coding projects should schedule an accessibility plan review with UX
  early in the project.
- Part of that plan will likely be to schedule an internal review with UX
  towards the end of the project.
- Most projects should, coordinated through UX, schedule a formal review by [MIT
  Assistive Technology Information Center
  (ATIC)](http://studentlife.mit.edu/atic/) towards the end of the project. The
  process and expectations for this should be discussed during the initial
  accessibility plan review.
- Use valid html 5 and our [style guide](/mitlib-style) to start out with a
  great baseline for accessible websites.
- Run some local checks throughout your development process to fix any issues
  you can as they come up, but don't stress about trying to pass every test on
  your own.
- Ask UX if something concerns you that you can't fix on your own so
  they can determine if they want to help now, or wait for the accessibility
  review at the end of the project.
- Accessibility reviews from UX and ATIC will provide guidance on resolving any
  issues before or shortly after a project goes into production.

## Implementing Open Source or Vended Solutions

- Discuss with UX whether an accessibility review is appropriate and who will
  lead the review.

## Automated Checking

- All of our public GitHub repos are set to automatically check via
  [AccessLint](https://www.accesslint.com), which is great for what it is
  but is _not_ a comprehensive Accessibility Plan.

## Manual testing

- The [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)](https://wave.webaim.org/) is
  useful for checking single web pages. It can be installed as a browser
  extension for either Chrome or Firefox.
- The [Accessible Name & Description Inspector (ANDI)
  tool](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html) is a
  Javascript tool to evaluate a loaded webpage.
