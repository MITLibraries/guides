### Pantheon

The MIT Libraries have made the choice to migrate many PHP-based websites to the [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/) platform.

#### Preferred Tooling and Workflow

There are a variety of processes and tools that can be used to build on Pantheon. In order to prevent confusion and conflicting processes, we recommend that sites be built along the lines of the [Build Tools documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/build-tools/), which includes the following tooling:

* GitHub
* CircleCI
* Composer
* Pantheon Multidev

In cases where this workflow is not feasible - primarily when migrating an existing website for which redevelopment is not possible - an FTP-based workflow that emphasizes the Pantheon dashboard in a web browser is also acceptable.
