# SSL Encryption

We support the trend of [adopting SSL encryption](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/deploying-https) across the internet.

New tools and sites that we develop will be compatible with systems that require SSL encryption. We will work with other technology staff at the Libraries to retrofit existing code as part of our regular maintenance work.
