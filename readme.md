#### Welcome to the MIT Libraries Developer Documentation site.

While this site is public and you are welcome to use it, our main goals are
internally facing. That said, feel free to open an Issue if you have suggestions
or feedback.

#### Side Nav Ordering
Page metadata should include `order: 1000` if you want your Page to
be included in the sidenav in alphabetical order. The readme uses
`order: 1` to pop to the top of that list. If you have reason to put
put your page in the sidenav in a different spot, you can use an
appropriate `order: value` to do so.
